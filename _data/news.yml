  date: 2024-11-08
  content: Andrew McDonald, Julia Kaltenborn and Kim Bente wrote a blogpost for the EGU Cryospheric Sciences blog ['Did you know? Machine learning can help us understand the cryosphere!'](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/2024/11/08/did-you-know-machine-learning-can-help-us-understand-the-cryosphere/). We provide a short case study on how machine learning can help cryospheric sciences, looking at mapping, forecasting and downscaling of Antarctic sea ice. We also introduce ML4Cryo and upcoming events. Enjoy your read!
